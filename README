				   Guppy 1.2

guppy is a tool to send a UDP ping to Gnutella servents. To compile guppy
just run "make". If the compile process succeeds, you'll find the executable
guppy in the "src" directory. To ping a host, run guppy like this:

	$ guppy localhost:6346
or
	$ guppy localhost 6346

The first parameter is the hostname, you can use a plain IPv4 address
as well. The second parameter respectively the value behind the colon
is the destination port. You can also use the parameter -s to force
a certain source port.
guppy sends at maximum 3 pings to the remote host. It terminates after
the first valid pong or when the timeout of 30 seconds exceeds.

Here's an example of a successful ping:

  $ guppy localhost:6346
  D ping.c(97): Host "localhost" resolved to: "127.0.0.1"
  D udp.c(544): recvfrom()=61 (from=127.0.0.1:6346)
  D udp.c(252): Got pong (ip=127.0.0.1, port=6346, files=11297, kbs=2097151)
  D udp.c(397): Daily Uptime: 46292 seconds
  D udp.c(447): Vendor: "GTKG" char=4c
  D udp.c(480): Extracted:
          RTT:    1s
          Peer:   127.0.0.1:6346

  I ping.c(59): Received valid pong


If the remote host doesn't respond, you'll see only something like this:

  $ src/guppy localhost 1027
  D ping.c(97): Host "localhost" resolved to: "127.0.0.1"
  W ping.c(84): Timeout exceeded, no pong received

If the parameter ``-c'' is used, guppy will add a GGEP SCP block to the
ping. This means the remote will return a few cached peer addresses in
the pong if it supports this feature. It's especially useful to ping a
UDP host cache (UHC). An UHC might not respond if you don't use this
parameter.

To scan a remote host, use the parameter ``-x''. guppy will then ping
all UDP ports 1-65535 in random order. It'll not terminate in this mode
but wait indefinitely. The progress is indicated by a percentage counter.
The ping rate is currently still hardcoded.

Happy ping flooding!
